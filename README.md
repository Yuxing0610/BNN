# Quantized Neural Network

**Under consruction!!!!!**

## Current progress
(1) check the random search v1 for bugs (No bug)

(2) Set the backpropagation baseline for quantized neural network (The results seem strange)

## For tomorrow
(1) implement the backpropagation for BNN alone, and compare the results with the original paper.

(2) check for the policy gradient descent and comapre if the update matrix of random search is a scale of the true gradient

(3) read "Searching for Low-bit Weights in Quantized Neural Networks", maybe combine NAS to find the right discrete values can be a good idea

## Random thing
(1) Try quark, ask alec for gradients

(2) 9.19 Google open intern roles
